Bash -> Born again shell

## Bash
Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’.

## Shell
Shell is a macro processor which allows for an interactive or non-interactive command execution.

## Scripting
Scripting allows for an automatic commands execution that would otherwise be executed interactively one-by-one.

| Befehl | Funktion |
| ---- | ---- |
| echo $SHELL | Mit welchem sprach interpreter man arbeitet |
| chmod +x FILENAME | File ausführbar machen |
| file FILENAME | er zeigt was für ein File es ist |
| ./FILENAME.sh | ausführen |

Probably the best analogy to explain a relative vs. absolute file path is to visualise GNU/Linux filesystem as a multiple storey building. The root directory (building’s entrance door) indicated by / provides the entry to the entire filesystem (building), hence giving access to all directories (levels/rooms) and files (people).
